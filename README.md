# Airbnb-Price-Prediction
Airbnb Price Prediction using a simple gradient descent algorithm

All the Airbnb data is in the data folder. All the data is in data.csv while the validation, testing and prediction sets are defined by the ids in their respective csv files. All the data is from a kaggle challenge from BU's Fall 2019 CS542 class.

To create the price predictions for the csv, you need numpy, pandas and Python3.

If the dependencies are met, then run 

```bash
python3 main.py 
```

from the root folder in the repo.
